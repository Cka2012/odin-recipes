                <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
                <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>4 oz freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>1 lb fettucine noodles (or desired pasta)</li>

        <h4>Shrimp</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 lbs large shrimp, thawed and peeled, tails optional</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon oil or butter (I prefer butter for the added flavor)</li>
